First React, Node, Express, Tailwind Project


Other
Vite, PostCSS




Structural (Why React)
Glorified Web Page, no state on server required. No state between sessions required.

Fun Things:

- Custom Tailwind Animations
- Sending state upwards is a pain
- MANY Dependencies, used to this from Java, but I have to get used to it in here
- React state control of tailwind css
- I prefer Vite over CRA
- Tailwind is amazing, Node is pretty alright, React I have to get used to
- Terinary Ops in css to change based on state (Really proud of), use Rem/Mod ops to calc
- SetInterval Counter lagging: Fixed by polling every 1/10 second, get floor of difference between start time and now. Only updats every second, but polls 1/10th to no get behind

Next Steps Personally:
- On a larger project, state management will be more important, may require statement manager like redux.
- Need to begin to take into account accessibility
